# REACT Developer Recruitment

We are hiring REACT developers. To apply, please develop a basic version of the Document Template Utility. Your code does not have to be fully functional. Any Pull Requests will be considered. Please read the README document in details. For questions, please submit an issue in the repo.

# Document Template Utility

The goal of the document Template Utility is to take a MS-Word or PDF as a template and fill in data from a JSON document, and generate a new PDF document.

The document template utility should be a REACT application. 
All required libraries must be able to run natively on web browsers.

### Examples:

See `HelpingHandContactTemplate.docx` and `HelpingHandContactTemplate.pdf` 

The template contains handle-bar style fields for data to be filled in from the JSON document.

```
{
	"doc":
	{
	"firstname": "Joe",
	"lastname": "Gen",
	"email": "jg@hand.com",
	"phone": "123-123-1234",
...
```


For sample: {{doc.firstname}} should be filled in with “Joe”

### Output:
The basic goal of the utility is to generate a new PDF document with data from the JSON document.
User should be able to download the generated PDF file.
